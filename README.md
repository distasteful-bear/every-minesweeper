# Every MineSweeper

## client

The client is a react native app built with expo. I have no idea how to deploy it, but to run it locally use:
`npm run web`

## server

The plan for this is a Golang Server with Gin

## logic

This is a brainstorming folder of sorts, to try out ideas in python and work out key problems like the algorithm to generate boards from indexes etc.
