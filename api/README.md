# API Code

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have Go installed and setup on path, such that this command works:
```
  go version
```

Then, build and run the go module by running this command from the /api/ directory where this README.md is.
```
  go run .
```

If starting up the server works properly, then you should be able to go to this link:
```
  localhost:8080/ping
```
And get this response:
```
  {"data":"Successful Ping!"}
```

## Learning GO
To learn go, I reccommend this learn Go by example project:

Also here is some basic GO documentation:
